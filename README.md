# Berkeley Environmental Health Explorer 

A comprehensive platform for analyzing climate data from various repositories and datasets.

## Features

1. **Search Data Repositories**: Find climate datasets from multiple sources with filtering options
2. **Explore Data**: Visualize and analyze climate data through interactive tables, charts, and maps
3. **Multiple Visualization Options**: View data as tables, cards, charts, or geographic maps

## Data Sources

This platform provides access to climate data from various sources:

1. **WorldClim** - Global climate data for current conditions, future projections, and past climate
2. **NOAA** - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate datasets
3. **NASA** - Earth observation and climate data from NASA
4. **ERA5** - ECMWF Reanalysis v5 climate data
5. **User-contributed** - Community-contributed climate datasets

## Technology Stack

1. **Strudel Kit** - A framework for building scientific web applications
2. **React** - For building the user interface
3. **Material UI** - For component styling and layout
4. **TypeScript** - For type-safe code
