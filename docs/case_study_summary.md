# STRUDEL Kit Case Study: Berkeley Campus & Community Canopy-Air Quality Hub (BCCAH)

## Introduction

This case study demonstrates how STRUDEL Kit can be effectively utilized in an educational setting to create a focused scientific web application. The Berkeley Campus & Community Canopy-Air Quality Hub (BCCAH) showcases STRUDEL's task flows and design system to build a user-centered tool for students learning about urban environmental health through hands-on data collection and analysis centered on the UC Berkeley campus.

## STRUDEL Kit Overview

STRUDEL (Scientific sofTware Research for User experience, Design, Engagement, and Learning) provides a framework ideal for developing scientific applications, including educational tools. It consists of:

1.  **Planning Framework**: Helps structure scientific project goals.
2.  **Design System**: Reusable components and patterns based on Task Flows.
3.  **Task Flows**: Predefined interaction patterns like Search Repositories, Explore Data, Compare Data, and Contribute Data, which form the backbone of the BCCAH application[3].

## Example Application: Berkeley Campus & Community Canopy-Air Quality Hub (BCCAH)

### Application Overview

The BCCAH is a web application designed primarily for UC Berkeley students. It enables them to discover, explore, compare, and contribute data related to tree inventory and air quality specifically on and around the Berkeley campus. Built with STRUDEL Kit, it integrates key task flows into a cohesive educational experience, turning the campus into a living laboratory[3].

### Why a Campus-Focused Environmental Hub?

Focusing on the UC Berkeley campus environment was chosen because:

1.  It provides a **tangible, relatable scale** for student learning and data collection.
2.  It naturally combines **complementary datasets** (trees, air quality) in a familiar setting.
3.  It enables meaningful **citizen science participation** as part of coursework.
4.  It leverages **local relevance** and allows students to see the immediate impact of environmental factors.
5.  It requires diverse **visualization capabilities** (maps, trends) suitable for teaching data analysis.
6.  It aligns with **educational goals** for environmental science, data science, and UX design courses.

### Implemented Task Flows (Educational Context)

The BCCAH implements four core STRUDEL task flows, adapted for student use on campus:

1.  **Search Repositories**: Find specific trees, buildings, or data points on the campus map using simple filters relevant to course topics[3].
2.  **Explore Data**: Visualize tree distribution, health, size, and nearby air quality readings through interactive campus maps and basic charts[3].
3.  **Compare Data**: Analyze differences in environmental conditions between various campus locations (e.g., sunny vs. shaded quads) or time periods[3].
4.  **Contribute Data**: Allow students, using mobile devices, to easily add observations like tree measurements (DBH, species, health) or spot air quality readings during fieldwork assignments[3].

### User Interface Design

The BCCAH interface follows STRUDEL's design principles, emphasizing:

1.  A clear, map-centric dashboard focused on the Berkeley campus.
2.  Task-based navigation intuitive for students.
3.  Consistent interactions across flows.
4.  Simplified, mobile-friendly forms for data contribution.
5.  Integration between flows (e.g., search result can be opened in explore view).

### Technical Implementation

The application leverages STRUDEL Kit's React components and templates[4][5] to:

1.  Integrate baseline campus tree data and nearby air quality sources.
2.  Manage student-contributed data, keeping it distinct but visualizable.
3.  Implement interactive mapping focused on campus geography.
4.  Provide basic data validation for student entries.
5.  Prioritize a mobile-responsive design for field contributions.

## Conclusion

This case study illustrates STRUDEL Kit's value not just for research platforms, but also for building effective, hands-on educational tools. By implementing the Berkeley Campus & Community Canopy-Air Quality Hub, educators can provide students with a practical, engaging platform to learn about urban environmental health, data science, and UX design principles using a real-world, hyper-local context. The framework accelerates development while ensuring a user-centered experience suitable for student interaction and contribution.
