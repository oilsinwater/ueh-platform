# STRUDEL Kit Case Study: Urban Environmental Health Platform

## Introduction

This case study demonstrates how STRUDEL Kit, a React framework for research software engineers, can be used to create a comprehensive scientific application. The Urban Environmental Health Platform (UEHP) showcases STRUDEL's task flows and design system to create a user-centered application that addresses real needs in understanding the relationship between urban trees and air quality.

## STRUDEL Kit Overview

STRUDEL (Scientific sofTware Research for User experience, Design, Engagement, and Learning) is a framework that enables teams to create user-centered software for scientific communities. It consists of:

1. **Planning Framework**: A conceptual tool for categorizing elements of scientific projects, helping identify and compare common activities in scientific work.

2. **Design System**: A set of reusable components and patterns organized around Task Flows, which are the stepwise flows a user takes to accomplish specified tasks.

3. **Task Flows**: Predefined interaction patterns for common scientific workflows, including:
   - Search Repositories
   - Explore Data
   - Compare Data
   - Contribute Data
   Plus home and about pages for context and navigation.

## Example Application: Urban Environmental Health Platform

### Application Overview

The Urban Environmental Health Platform (UEHP) is a comprehensive web application that enables environmental scientists, urban planners, and citizen scientists to discover, explore, analyze, and contribute to urban tree inventory and air quality data. It integrates multiple STRUDEL task flows to create a seamless user experience for working with these interconnected datasets.

### Why Urban Environmental Health?

Urban Environmental Health data analysis was selected as the optimal example application because:

1. It naturally combines two complementary datasets (urban trees and air quality)
2. It enables meaningful citizen science contributions
3. It has clear local relevance and impact
4. It requires diverse visualization capabilities (maps, time series)
5. It includes both individual and collaborative aspects
6. It addresses scientifically relevant and broadly accessible environmental health concerns

### Implemented Task Flows

The UEHP implements four key STRUDEL task flows:

1. **Search Repositories**: Enables users to search across urban tree inventories and air quality monitoring data with filtering options for location, time periods, and measurement types.

2. **Explore Data**: Provides interactive visualization tools including map overlays of tree coverage and air quality measurements, time series analysis, and statistical summaries.

3. **Compare Data**: Allows analysis of relationships between tree coverage and air quality metrics, with tools for temporal and spatial correlation analysis.

4. **Contribute Data**: Enables citizens and researchers to contribute tree inventory data and air quality measurements, with built-in validation processes.

### User Interface Design

The UEHP interface is designed following STRUDEL's design system principles, with:

1. Responsive layout with adjustable panels
2. Task-based navigation structure
3. Consistent interaction patterns across all task flows
4. Specialized interfaces for data validation and contribution
5. Integration between task flows for seamless analysis

### Technical Implementation

The application leverages STRUDEL Kit's React components and templates to implement:

1. Integration of urban tree inventory and air quality data sources
2. Support for standardized data formats
3. Interactive mapping and visualization components
4. Data validation workflows for citizen contributions
5. Collaborative features for community engagement

## Conclusion

This case study demonstrates how STRUDEL Kit provides a powerful framework for building scientific applications. By implementing the Urban Environmental Health Platform using STRUDEL's task flows and design system, research software engineers can create a comprehensive, user-centered application that addresses real environmental health needs while maintaining development efficiency and consistency.
