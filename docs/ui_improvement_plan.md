# Plan to Address Gaps in BCCAH UI

## Introduction

The BCCAH platform has several gaps in its UI that need to be addressed following the pivot from climate data to urban environmental health. This document outlines a plan to address these gaps and integrate the requirements from the `bccah-data-plan.md` document.

## Identified Gaps

1. Home Page: Lacks a campus map overview and recent student contributions feed.
2. Search Interface: Missing an explicit map view.
3. Contribution Interface: Lacks a map-based location picker and clear instructions.

## Detailed Plan

### Home Page

1. Implement a campus map overview using an interactive map component.
2. Add a recent student contributions feed.

### Search Interface

1. Integrate an explicit map view to display search results for trees.
2. Ensure filtering options are available and functional.

### Contribution Interface

1. Add a map-based location picker for users to select the location of their contributions.
2. Provide clear instructions for data contribution.

## Integration with `bccah-data-plan.md`

The `bccah-data-plan.md` document outlines the strategy for data integration and UI interactions. The plan includes:
- Differentiating between baseline and contributed data visually.
- Implementing filtering, sorting, and exploration capabilities.

## Conclusion

By addressing the identified gaps and integrating the requirements from `bccah-data-plan.md`, the BCCAH platform will fully meet the PRD requirements and provide a robust and user-friendly experience for urban environmental health data collection and analysis.
